## What is this user's avatar of?
Spent a little while trying to think of a 3 letter word for the windows xp background before moving onto the exif haha
We see in the exif data via exiftool under copyright - what looks like a username.
`OWoodflint`
Googling this gives us a twitter, github and wordpress result. (and some walkthroughs for this room)
Twitter avatar is a picture of an english shorthair, so our first answer: cat

## What city is this person in?
Initially tried this with the gps position from the exif data but that pointed us in the ocean (user error maybe)
coming from an easier vector, the google search results:
Github profile says 'Hi all, I am from London'
ez 1

## What's the SSID of the WAP he's connected to?
Back to the exif data (and the hint from previous question that suggests using bssid wigle) 
His Twitter mentions having free home wifi, linking a bssid for whatever reason
We search this using wigle, finding a wifi access point in London (intended vector for previous question I guess)
The SSID of this access point is 'UnileverWiFi' - there's our answer.

## What is his personal email address?
Following the github link to his project, he has an email listed for people to get involved with his open source project:
`OWoodflint@gmail.com`

## What site did you find his email address on?
github

## Where has he gone on holiday?
Wordpress blog says he's in New York - that's our answer

## What is this person's password?
This one tripped me up a little, almost started trying to reset it and get into his wordpress.
The password actually shows up on the wordpress result for some reason (since it's on the page in 'hidden' text)
