# Tools R Us
Learning / practising tools

### What directory can you find, that begins with a G?
Just running a dirbuster scan here, we find guidelines
### Whose name can you find from this directory?
visiting /guidelines we see 'hey bob, did you update that tomcat server?'
shows us there's a bob, and a tomcat server which is probably vulnerable (why would this note be here tho?)
### What directory has basic authentication?
just visiting the dirs from the scan, protected asks us for auth
### What is bob's password to the protected part of the website?
tried to guess my way through using hydra but wasn't doing well so moving over to the hydra intro room
